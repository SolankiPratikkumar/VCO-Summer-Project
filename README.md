## What is Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO)?

*
* The higher the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator, the lower the VCO phase noise is. However, higher Q circuits have narrower frequency ranges. Increasing the power supply will also lower the phase noise
* One strategy for minimizing phase noise in such VCOs is to increase the voltage tuning range of the VTUNE to the VCO
