## What is Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO)?

* A voltage-controlled oscillator is an oscillator with an output signal whose output can be varied over a range, which is controlled by the input DC voltage. It is an oscillator whose output frequency is directly related to the voltage at its input. The oscillation frequency varies from few hertz to hundreds of GHz. By varying the input DC voltage, the output frequency of the signal produced is adjusted.


## Voltage Controlled Oscillator Applications

* Function generator by square and triangular wave generator
* Music Synthesizers generate audio signals that can be manipulated to create various sounds and effects
* Phase locked loop (PLL) main component in this system
* Frequency synthesizers or generators/analyzers, to generate stable output frequencies that are integer multiples of a reference frequency
* Frequency Modulation (FM) Radio Transmitters and Receivers use for carrier frequency
* Electronic jamming equipment by generating a continuous wave or modulated signal at the same frequency as the target system's operating frequency
* Clock Generation in microprocessor,FPGA, DSP application
* Radar Systems by generate the necessary frequencies for transmitting radar pulses and processing the returned echoes
* Motor Speed Control by controlling the frequency of a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal to regulate motor speed precisely
* GPS Receivers helps in generating the high-precision frequencies required to lock onto satellite signals and determine position
* Television by generating the carrier signal for tuning into different channels

## VCO

* In RC and LC based VCO Circuts the frequency is given by f=1/2piRC and f= 1/2pirt(LC) respectively so as C value decreases the output f increase by inversely proportionate and as it follows Linear relation with voltage, hence also so as input voltage increase the output frequency increases,, same follows for other case   
* The control voltage and frequency of oscillations are directly proportional. That is, when one increases, the other will increase.

* We can see that at nominal control voltage represented by Vc(nom), the oscillator works at its free running or normal frequency, fC(nom). As the control voltage decreases from nominal voltage, the frequency also decreases and as the nominal control voltage increases, the frequency also gets higher.

* The output waveform of this VCO will be square wave. As we know the output frequency is related to the control voltage.
* In this circuit the first Op-amp will function as an integrator.
* The voltage divider arrangement is implemented here. Because of this, the half of the control voltage that is given as input is given to the positive terminal of the Op-amp 1. The same level of voltage is maintained at the negative terminal. This is to sustain the voltage drop across the resistor, R1 as half of the control voltage.
* When the MOSFET is in ON condition, the current flowing from the R1 resistor passes through the MOSFET. The R2 have half the resistance, same voltage drop and twice the current as that of R1. So, the extra current charges the connected capacitor. The Op-amp 1 should provide a gradually increasing output voltage to supply this current.
* When the MOSFET is in OFF condition, the current flowing from the R1 resistor passes through the capacitor, get discharged. The output voltage obtained from the Op-amp 1 at this time will be falling. As a result, a triangular waveform is generated as the output of Op-amp 1.
* The Op-amp 2 will operate as Schmitt trigger. The input to this Op-amp is triangular wave which is the output of the Op-amp 1.
* If the input voltage is higher than the threshold level, the output from the Op-amp 2 will be VCC.
* If the input voltage is less than the threshold level, the output from the Op-amp 2 will be zero. Therefore, the output of the Op-amp 2 will be square wave.

## Performance Parameter

* Consider the unity-gain negative-feedback
             Vout/Vin(s) = H(s)/[1 + H(s)]
* if a negative-feedback circuit has a loop gain that satisfies two conditions:
* |H(jω0)| ≥ 1
*  H(jω0) = 180

* Center Frequency: The center frequency (i.e., the midrange value in Fig. 15.40) is determined by the environment in which the VCO is used. For example, in the clock generation network of a microprocessor,the VCO may be required to run at the clock rate or even twice that. Today’s CMOS VCOs achieve center frequencies as high as hundreds of gigahertz.
* Tuning Range:  The required tuning range is dictated by two parameters: (1) the variation of the VCO center frequency with process and temperature, and (2) the frequency range necessary for the application.The center frequency of some CMOS oscillators may vary by a factor of two at the extremes of process and temperature, thus mandating a sufficiently wide (≥ 2×) tuning range to guarantee that the VCO output frequency can be driven to the desired value. Also, some applications incorporate clock frequencies that must vary by one to two orders of magnitude depending on the mode of operation, demanding a proportionally wide tuning range. An important concern in the design of VCOs is the disturbance of the output phase and frequency as a result of noise on the control line. For a given noise amplitude, the noise in the output frequency is proportional to KVCO because ωout = ω0 + KVCO Vcont .
* Tuning Linearity: Actual oscillator characteristics typically exhibit a high-gain region in the middle of the range and a low gain at the two extremes. Compared to a linear characteristic (the gray line), the actual behavior displays a maximum gain greater than that predicted by implying that, for a given tuning range, nonlinearity inevitably leads to higher sensitivity for some region of the characteristic.
* Output Amplitude : It is desirable to achieve a large output oscillation amplitude, thus making the waveform less sensitive to noise. The amplitude trades with power dissipation, supply voltage, and even the tuning range. Also, the amplitude may vary across the tuning range,an undesirable effect.
* Power Dissipation: As with other analog circuits, oscillators suffer from trade-offs among speed, power dissipation, and noise. Typical oscillators drain 1 to 10 mW of power
* Output Signal Purity: Even with a constant control voltage, the output waveform of a VCO is not perfectly periodic. The electronic noise of the devices in the oscillator and supply noise lead to noise in the output phase and frequency. These effects are quantified by “jitter” and “phase noise” and determined by the requirements of each application

* Load Impedance: The impedance that the VCO is designed to drive, usually expressed in ohms (Ω).
* Modulation Bandwidth: The maximum rate at which the VCO can be modulated by the input control voltage without significant distortion or loss of signal integrity.
* Phase Jitter: A measure of the short-term frequency stability of the VCO, often specified in seconds or as an integrated value over a specific frequency range.

* The higher the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator, the lower the VCO phase noise is. However, higher Q circuits have narrower frequency ranges. Increasing the power supply will also lower the phase noise
* One strategy for minimizing phase noise in such VCOs is to increase the voltage tuning range of the VTUNE to the VCO
